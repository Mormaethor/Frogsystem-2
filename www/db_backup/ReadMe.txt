Note:
  This directory is used by admin_db_backup.php to save backup files.
  The .htaccess file in this directory should deny any access to this folder,
  so it should be save - at least on servers that run Apache and thus under-
  stand the .htaccess settings. We still have to figure out a better method
  that works for other servers, too.
