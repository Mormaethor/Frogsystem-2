hi, hi there

in www you can find the content.

the frogsystem.sql contains the mysql data plus some example content. make sure you import it on an database called "frogsystem" (without ""), or the whole thing won't work.

at last change the passowrd and username at the top of the www/login.inc.php or even better use the default values...

hope everything will work! ;)

have fun & Look forward Sweil *g*
