Active branches:

  - alix6_neu: This is the most recent branch for the next release alix6. Use this foryour active development.
  - master:    This will always be the branch of the latest release. After a new release the
               specific branch will be merged into this one.

Unused branches:

  - alix6:    This was the original branch for alix6. But I got stuck there, so alix6_neu is used now.
              May contain some useful changes.
  - dead_end: As it says: this is a dead end.
  - future:   This branch was for testing purposes only. You may use it to test some long-distance changes.
  - HEAD:     Old master-branch from the original SVN repo. Don't use it.
